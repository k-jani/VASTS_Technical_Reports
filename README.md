Consists of all technical reports and corresponding graphics for reports through the VASTS 2023 program. 

Summary of VASTS from VSGC webpage: 
The Virginia Aerospace Science and Technology Scholars (VASTS) program is an interactive on-line science, technology, engineering and mathematics learning experience. Students who perform highly in the online program can be potentially invited to a seven-day residential summer academy at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) in Hampton, VA. Students selected to participate in the Summer Academy program are immersed in NASA-related research through interaction with scientists, engineers, and technologists.
